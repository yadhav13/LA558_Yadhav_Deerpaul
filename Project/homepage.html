      <h1>History</h1>
      
      <p>Malaria was spreading at an alarming on the island of Mauritius during the late nineteenth century. The British Government instated a Sanitary Commission in 1879 to recommend laws which could potentially reverse the spiraling outbreak.</p>
      <p>Charles Meldrum, a meteorologist and astronomer based in Mauritius, wrote a report exploring the links between the spread of malaria, global climatic anomalies, sunspot theories and the impacts of deforestation. He contested the report that Andrew Davidson had prepared for the Sanitary Commission of 1882. Davidson was a physician in Mauritius and he attributed the spread of malaria to miasmatic influences exacerbated by deforestation. The now obsolete miasma theory attributed the cause of diseases to the miasma from rotting organic matter.</p>
      <p>Meldrum relied on what would soon proved as the scientifically correct germ theory, notably that microscopic organisms are the cause of diseases, to counter Davidson. The project is a visual analysis of the colonial datasets.</p>

      <h1>Project</h1>
      
      <p>In the GIS project, I have analyzed the datasets on health, and weather statistics compiled by Charles Meldrum during the nineteenth century from different districts of Mauritius during the period 1871–1879. Additionally, I have also looked at the chronology of the spread of malaria from January 1865 to May 1866 which he had also referenced.</p>
      <p>My main hypothesis was to determine if there was a strong correlation between malaria, climate and deforestation in Mauritius. The chart below such potential correlations which can be further explored using the interactive maps and charts.</p>

      <p>The research project is an ongoing one. Some data sources might be incomplete and the historical coordinates might require further adjustments.</p>

      <h2><i>Correlating Fever Mortality and Rainfall Patterns in British Mauritius from 1871 to 1879</i></h2>
      
      <p>The two maps show the links between fever mortality and rainfall patterns during the period 1871–1879. If you select specific district(s), it will change across both maps. However, each map has their respective yearly filters.</p>
