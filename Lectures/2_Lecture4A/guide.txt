# Set working directory
## I have my own workflow for R and I prefer moving the files to my GitHub repository manually. I start by setting up my working directory.

setwd("/Users/yadhav/Downloads/2_Lecture4A")

# Load packages
## I use pacman to load packages, the here package to import the files and tidyverse for plotting. Guide: https://epirhandbook.com/en/r-basics.html#how-to-install-and-load.

pacman::p_load(
  here,
  tidyverse
)

# Import data
## I use here package to import data: https://epirhandbook.com/en/import-and-export.html#here.

fever_districts <- rio::import(here("datasets/1_fever_districts_1879.csv"))

# Make basic bar chart
## I use ggplot to make a basic bar chart. Guide: https://epirhandbook.com/en/ggplot-basics.html.

ggplot(fever_districts, aes(x = Districts, y = Value))+ # data and axes
geom_col( # display chart
color = "red", # border color
fill = "blue", # inside color
alpha = 0.1) # transparency effect

# Make second chart
## For the second chart, I will use the file on mortality to create a scatterplot with groupings based on districts. I am employing only the 1879 figures for now but I will integrate other years in future renditions of the project. I will also sort out the binning for the values to be more meaningful. Guide: https://epirhandbook.com/en/ggplot-basics.html#ggplotgroups.

mortality_districts <- rio::import(here("datasets/2_mortality_districts_1879.csv"))

ggplot(data = mortality_districts,
mapping = aes(x = Districts, y = Value, color = Districts))+
geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
