# Assignment 3

## Description

The following page includes information on Assignment 3. The first two figures have been rendered using data from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/) by using the package *TidyCensus*. The dataset employed for the rainfall is from the same archival source used in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/yadhav13/LA558_Yadhav_Deerpaul/tree/main/Assignments/2.%20Assignment%201) but the difference is that I chose to use climatic rather than health variables.
