<h1>Assignment 1</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>For Assignment 1, I displayed the percentage of fever mortality over total mortality in the island of Mauritius during the year 1879.</p>
<p>I obtained the district boundaries and the boundaries of the island from the <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-mus?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a>.</p>
<p>On QGIS, I did a join of the map with the statistical data I transcribed from the reports of the Sanitary Commission (1882) which I previously digitized from the National Archives of Mauritius. I then created a new column to calculate the percentage of fever mortality over total mortality using natural jenks.</p>
<p>The district boundaries of the island did not change from the British colonization of the island in the nineteenth century but there are two issue with the current map: the islets which are connected to the closest district boundaries were largely uninhabited; the land around Port Louis has been largely reclaimed in recent times.</p>
