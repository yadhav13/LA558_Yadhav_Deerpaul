<h1>Assignment 4</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The data for <b>Map 1</b> has been derived from Charles Meldrum's report (pages 64â€“65) in the <i>Sanitary Commission (1882)</i> which has been employed in <a href="https://yadhav13.github.io/LA558_Yadhav_Deerpaul/Assignments/2.%20Assignment%201/description.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assignment 1</a> as well. Map is a modification of <a href="https://yadhav13.github.io/LA558_Yadhav_Deerpaul/Assignments/3_Assignment_2/#figure-2-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assignment 2</a>.</p>

<p>The locations have been derived from contemporary maps. The actual locations need to be updated to correspond to historic maps such as by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mauritius_1880_map_by_Descubes.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexandar Descubes</a>. The transcription of the data and its methodological assessment is incomplete as at now.</p>
